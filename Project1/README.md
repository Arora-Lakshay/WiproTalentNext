# How to Compile and Run Project1

The folder `Project1` in the current directory is the main package that contains the complete source code for this project.

NOTE - I'm not using any kind of IDE (such as Ecllipse or NetBeans).

## How to Compile

Use the following commands in the terminal to compile the package.
### `$ cd Solution`
### `$ javac Project1\Project1.java`

The above commands will Compile whole package and generate Bytecode(.class files) for each public class.

## How to Run

After the compilation, make sure you must be in the `Solution` directory.
Use the following commands in the terminal to generate the outputs.
### `$ java Project1\Project1 <EMP_ID>`

NOTE - In place of `<EMP_ID>` you have to write the Emp. No. for which you are looking for.


### Example

Let's suppose if we want to see the details of an Employee with Emp. No. 1003 then,

### `$ java Project1\Project1 1003`
