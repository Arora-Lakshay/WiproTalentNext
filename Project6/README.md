# How to Compile and Run Project6

The folder `Project6` in the current directory is the main package that contains the complete source code for this project.

NOTE - I'm not using any kind of IDE (such as Ecllipse or NetBeans).

## How to Compile

Use the following commands in the terminal to compile the package.
### `$ cd Project6`
### `$ javac Project6\Project6.java`

The above commands will Compile whole package and generate Bytecode(.class files) for each public class.

## How to Run

After the compilation, make sure you must be in the `Project6` directory.
Use the following commands in the terminal to generate the outputs.
### `$ java Project6\Project6`

This program implements a very simple set of Cards. The program keeps on adding a new Card to the set until there will be four unique Cards (i.e. of different groups) entered by the user. After that, first occurence of Card of each group is displayed to the user through terminal.
