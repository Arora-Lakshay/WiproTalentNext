# How to Compile and Run Project5

The folder `Project5` in the current directory is the main package that contains the complete source code for this project.

NOTE - I'm not using any kind of IDE (such as Ecllipse or NetBeans).

## How to Compile

Use the following commands in the terminal to compile the package.
### `$ cd Project5`
### `$ javac Project5\Project5.java`

The above commands will Compile whole package and generate Bytecode(.class files) for each public class.

## How to Run

After the compilation, make sure you must be in the `Project5` directory.
Use the following commands in the terminal to generate the outputs.
### `$ java Project5\Project5`

Now, you can perform various list operations provided by the program according to the choices provided through terminal.
